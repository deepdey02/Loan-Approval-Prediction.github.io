 Loan Approval Prediction System | Machine Learning + Flask Web App Deployment 

In this video, we build and deploy a Loan Approval Prediction System using Python , Flask , and Machine Learning . Watch as we break down the backend code, load the trained model with joblib, handle real user inputs with pandas, encode categorical features, and serve predictions through a sleek, professional web interface 

By the end, youâ€™ll know how to turn a trained model into a real-time interactive web application. Whether youâ€™re just getting started with deployment or looking to enhance your projects with predictive analytics, this video is your guide

 Features:
âœ” Real-time loan approval predictions 
âœ” Scaled and encoded inputs for accuracy 
âœ” Clean, intuitive UI for a smooth user experience ðŸ–¥
âœ” Local Flask deployment walkthrough 

 How it Works:
Users enter details like age, income, employment length, loan amount, and credit history. The system preprocesses this data and feeds it into a pre-trained ML model to instantly predict whether the loan will be approved or not.
